## Value Proposal

**Summer weddings** are in full swing!! To help make wedding planning easier, we would like to develop a _wedding planner web application_ that will help any wedding planner easily plan and organize all the details surrounding the big day. This proposed application will allow users to create a profile under which they can create **one** or **more** wedding plans.

## Concept

This platform will leverage a full stack web application that will allow planning and management of a clientâ€™s wedding. Weddings are significant events in people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are well-organized. Wedding Planner allows you to keep all of your guests, invitations, and more in one place.
