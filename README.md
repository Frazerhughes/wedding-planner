## Value Proposal

**Summer weddings** are in full swing!! To help make wedding planning easier, we would like to develop a _wedding planner web application_ that will help any wedding planner easily plan and organize all the details surrounding the big day. This proposed application will allow users to create a profile under which they can create **one** or **more** wedding plans.

## User Stories

```

I WANT to be able to have a platform to plan my event end to end
SO THAT I can plan and organize guests, venue, and other related items
```

```
AS a wedding planner

SO THAT I can better plan an awesome wedding
```

## Concept

This platform will leverage a full stack web application that will allow `planning` and `management` of a clientâ€™s wedding. Weddings are significant events in people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are well-organized. Wedding Planner allows you to keep all of your guests, invitations, and more in one place.

#### UML Diagram

- The user needs to get registered by entering all the details in the registration form.
- The user can get login by entering unique username and password.
- The user can add events like the type of event, decoration, guests, invitations, budget and more.
- The user can manage the events (update or delete).
- The user can logout.

## Developing

#### MVP

- Allow user to save, edit, and compare multiple wedding times.
- Allow user to create guest list.
- Allow user to send invitations.
- Allow guests to RSVP from a link they get by email.
- Allow user to see venue address and map.
- Displays high quality images associated with the event location.

---

## Technology

- Model-View-Controller (**MVC**) framework as an architectural pattern.
- Node and Express server.
- Handlebars.js as the template engine or React.js.
- MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM.
- AJAX POST-request and AJAX GET-request for retrieving and adding new data.
- Deploy web app using Heroku (with data).
- NPM passport package to manage the access to the plataform based on _admin_, _user_ and _wedding planner_.

---

## Future Development

If time `allows`, we would like to incorporate the feature `enhancements` to our web application:

- Add actual wedding data such as picture and video.
- Generate guests friendly interface with memories of the event.
- Allow capability to order memorabilia items based on data of the event.
- Develop corresponding mobile app.
